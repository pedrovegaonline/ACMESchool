# ACME School

### What things would you have liked to do but didn't do?
I'd like to complete the abstract classes for the payment process and all the tests. 

### What things did you do but you think could be improved or would be necessary to return to them if the project goes ahead?
The project would need improvement in the implementation of the services as well as to complete the payment gateway  

### What third-party libraries have you used and why
I didn't have time to use any third-party library, and I didn't invest enough time to think of any particular library that I could use in this state, unfortunately.

### How much time do you have invested in doing the project, what things you have had to research, and what things were new to you.
I didn't invest the necessary time to complete all the tasks and requirements. I could only invest approximately 2-3 hours between research and complete the tasks as much as I could.
